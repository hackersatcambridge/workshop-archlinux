This workshop will introduce you to Arch Linux, one of the many distributions available.
We'll talk about how to set it up, make it your own, and derive a sense of pride and accomplishment.

This hands-on workshop takes you from a blank terminal to a fully functional machine with a configured keyboard layout, internet connectivity, drive partitioned and properly formatted, DNS resolution configured and more.
